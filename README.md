# Link Report Crawler

## Summary

This is a command line application built with nodejs that crawls a web site and prints a report to the console showing the number of links to each page on the site.  The app sorts the links from highst to lowest.

## Build Process

I built this app by following the project guidelines and video on [boot.dev](https://boot.dev).

## Coming Soon

I plan to add some more functionality to this app in the near future.
