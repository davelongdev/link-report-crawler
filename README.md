# Link Report Crawler

## Summary

This is a command line application built with Node.js and JavaScript that crawls a web site and prints a report to the console showing the number of links to each page on the site.  

The app sorts the links from highst number of links to the lowest number of links.

## Build Process

I built this app by following the project guidelines and video on [boot.dev](https://boot.dev).

## Coming Soon

I plan to add some more functionality to this app in the near future.  Ideas for additional functionality:

- show outgoing links in a seperate category
- print output to a txt file or csv file.
